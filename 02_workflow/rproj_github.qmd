## Version History is NOT Version Control

::: notes
Version history is not the same as version control. Version history is a record of changes made to a file, while version control is a system that manages changes to files and allows for collaboration among multiple users. Version control systems like Git provide features such as branching, merging, and conflict resolution, which are essential for collaborative work.
