## Version control and collaboration

![](images/version_history_and_control.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

::: notes
Version history is not the same as version control. Version history is a record of changes made to a file, while version control is a system that manages changes to files and allows for collaboration among multiple users. Version control systems like Git provide features such as branching, merging, and conflict resolution, which are essential for collaborative work.

## Version control with git and GitHub

## Repositories

Repositories, aka "repos", represent independent file environments on GitHub.

::: notes
Point out:
- file structure: has files and folders
- README: emphasize the importance of a README file for providing context and instructions for the repository
- license: mention that the license file is important for specifying how others can use the code and data in the repository
- contributors: can see who has contributed to the repository and their contributions

## Forking a repository

You can easily make your own copy of a repository by "forking" it

![](images/cpeg_repo_fork.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

::: notes
Walk through this process with everyone. Make sure everyone has forked the repository before moving on.
:::

## Cloning your new repository

Now we're going to "clone" this repo to our local machine using GitHub Desktop. You can also do this in RStudio, but we will use GitHub Desktop for this example.

::: notes
Walk through this process with everyone. You will need to select the folder where you want to clone the repository. Make sure everyone has cloned the repository before moving on.

## Making a new R project

Now let's make a new R project based on this cloned repository...

## Git in RStudio

![](images/git_panel.png){fig-align="center"}

## Making and committing changes {.smaller}

Now let's make some changes to the repository:

1. Open the `README.md` file in RStudio and add some text to it. Perhaps your name or today's date. Make sure to save the file.
2. You'll now see that the `README.md` file has been modified in the Git panel in RStudio.
3. Click the checkbox next to the `README.md` file in the Git panel to stage the changes.
4. In the "Commit message" box, write a brief description of the changes you made (e.g., "Added my name to README").
5. Click the "Commit" button to commit the changes to your local repository.
6. Click the "Push" button in the Git panel to upload your changes to GitHub.

## Advanced GitHub {.smaller}

Some other topics that you can explore on your own:

- [Branching and Merging](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow): Manage changes to your codebase with branches and merge them back into the main branch
- [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues): Track bugs and feature requests (yes, this applies to research code!)
- [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests): Propose changes to a repository and collaborate with others
- [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions): Automate workflows
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/): Host websites directly from your GitHub repository
