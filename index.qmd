University of ZÃ¼rich (ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland)

# Welcome

R is one of the most popular languages in the world of data science and has been widely adopted by the paleobiological and ecological communities for data analysis. General familiarity with R allows users to automate routine tasks, create reproducible analytical workflows, and expand the potential of their research. This workshop aims to introduce participants to the versatility of R for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing paleobiological and ecological data. It will cover topics including: data acquisition from biodiversity databases such the Paleobiology Database, Neotoma Paleoecology Database, and Global Biodiversity Information Facility; building workflows in R to clean and analyze data; data visualization and synthesis; and guidelines (e.g., FAIR and CARE principles) and tools (e.g., GitHub) for creating more reproducible code and accessible documentation. In doing so, this workshop will introduce attendees to palaeoverse, an R package that supports data preparation and exploration for paleobiological analysis. Participants will also become familiar with additional packages developed by Palaeoverse [www.palaeoverse.org](www.palaeoverse.org), such as rphylopic. More broadly, this event aims to connect participants working in different fields who share a common interest in data science and provide a platform for participants to gain experience working collaboratively in R to generate reproducible interdisciplinary research.

<p>You can find additional information about the workshop [here](https://www.cpeg-cpb25.uzh.ch/en/additional_activities/workshop_1.html).</p>

## Installation

Please ensure that you have the latest version of R for the workshop, which can be downloaded [here for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) or [here for MacOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/). We also recommend installing the latest version of RStudio, which can be downloaded [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). To minimize any installation issues during the workshop, please also install the following R packages:

```{R install}
#| eval: false
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("palaeoverse")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("rnaturalearth")
install.packages("rnaturalearthdata")
install.packages("deeptime")
